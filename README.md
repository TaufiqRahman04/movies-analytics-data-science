# Movies Analytics Data Science

This repository contains an exploratory data science project focused on analyzing movie datasets. The project covers a variety of approaches, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, to better understand patterns in movie ratings, genres, revenues, and audience behavior.

## Contents
- **Movie_Analaytics.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the exploration and analysis.  
- **datasets/** (optional): Source data used for the project.  

## Key Explorations
- Distribution of movie ratings across different categories  
- Popularity trends of genres over time  
- Relationship between budget, revenue, and profitability  
- Correlation between audience ratings and other variables  
- Visualizations to highlight key insights  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- (Optional) Scikit-learn for modeling  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/movies-analytics-data-science.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Movie_Analaytics.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.  

## Notes
This is an exploratory project, so multiple methods and analyses are tested and compared throughout the notebook. The goal is to practice and showcase different data science techniques rather than build a single final model.
